Some attributes are required for all items, some are required for certain types of items (such as apparel), and others are recommended. Failure to provide a required attribute may prevent that particular item from showing up in Google Shopping results, whereas failure to provide recommended attributes may result in items showing up less frequently.</p>

            <td class="details"><p>Unique product identifiers are product codes or other values associated with an individual product. The primary set of unique product identifiers are Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs), which include UPC, EAN (in Europe), JAN (in Japan), and ISBN.</p>
            <p>In addition, a Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) can be used to identify a specific product in the 'mpn' attribute if it is accompanied by the manufacturer's brand name in the 'brand' attribute. These values are very important for matching users' queries to your products.</p></td>

            <td class="details"><p>Apparel and items that fall within the broad categorization of Apparel & Accessories (e.g. Shoes, Handbags, Jewelry, Accessories, etc.) comprise a large chunk of online sales. Google is investing in making the shopping experience for Apparel much richer and more intuitive. Apparel is also unique in that shoppers often browse / look for items of a specific color, size, pattern, or material. Accordingly, they require that merchants send them variant attributes, which are</p>
            <ul>
            <li>‘color’</li>
            <li>‘size’</li>
            <li>‘pattern’</li>
            <li>‘material’</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This article will help you determine which attributes are required and which are recommended for apparel products; however, please be sure to review the Feed Specification carefully as well.</p></td>

            <td class="details"><p>Products are categorized in Google's search results based on a number of factors. While they can't guarantee that a product will show in a particular category, you can increase the chances that your products will be included in relevant categories by sending us highly structured information for your items. To categorize the products in your feeds, you can use two attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The ‘Google product category’ attribute:</li> 
                    <ul><li>For this attribute, use one of the categories defined in the Google product taxonomy</li></ul>
